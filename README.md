## Fetching the games

axios is used to make HTTP requests. After axios is installed (_npm i axios_), create an axios instance (_api-client.ts file_) with custom configuration. In that configuration, include the API key which was copied from the website.

To send a fetch request to the backend, `effect` hook is used (_GameGrid.tsx file_). Call api-client and with `get()` method, send a request to "/games" endpoint. Create an interface that represents the shape of the response object.

interface Game {
id: number;
name: string;
}

interface FetchGamesResponse {
count: number;
results: Game[];
}

When sending get request to the server, use angle brackets <> to provide a generic type argument. With that, we know the shape of the response object. Then grab the response and setGames to data.results which is an array of objects (Game)

apiClient.get<_FetchGamesResponse_>("/games).then(res => setGames(res.data.results))

## Creating a custom hook for fetching games

The `AbortController` is a useful feature in JavaScript that allows you to cancel ongoing network requests, such as those made with the Fetch API. In a Vite React TypeScript project, using `AbortController` can help you manage and clean up network requests effectively.

### Why Use `AbortController`

1. _Canceling Requests:_ If a component unmounts or if a user navigates away before a fetch request completes, `AbortController` allows you to cancel that request to prevent unnecessary processing and resource usage.

2. _Improving Performance:_ Canceling requests that are no longer needed can help improve the performance of your application by avoiding processing responses that will not be used.

3. _Preventing Memory Leaks:_ In single-page applications (SPAs), components can mount and unmount frequently. Using `AbortController` can help prevent memory leaks by ensuring that any outstanding network requests are properly terminated.

4. _Better Error Handling:_ When a request is aborted, you can handle this case explicitly in your error handling logic, allowing you to differentiate between canceled requests and other types of errors.

### How to use `AbortController`

- _Creating an AbortController:_ An instance of `AbortController` is created, which can be used to signal aborting the fetch request.

- _Signal Usage:_ The `signal` property from the controller is passed to the fetch request. This allows the fetch to listen for abort signals.

- _Error Handling:_ If the request is aborted, the error will be of type `AbortError`, which you can handle separately.

- _Cleanup Function:_ The cleanup function in the `useEffect` hook calls `controller.abort()`, ensuring that any ongoing request is canceled when the component unmounts.

### Conclusion

Using `AbortController` in your Vite React TypeScript project helps you manage network requests more effectively, leading to better performance and resource management. Itâ€™s a best practice to include this when dealing with asynchronous data fetching in components.

## Filtering games by genre

When click on a genre from the genre list, games will be shown by order of selected genre. But how?

We need to share the selected genre with game grid. To share state between 2 components, we should lift it up to the closest parent. In this scenario, _App_ component is the parent. That's where we have the genre list and game grid. So, we have to declare a state variable for storing the selected genre.

Because of typescript, you need to specify the type of the argument, which is _Genre_. However, even if you specify the type, there will be a compilation error saying `Argument of type 'null' is not assignable to parameter of type 'Genre | (() => Genre)'.` So, we should say that this variable can either hold a _Genre_ object or null.

`const [selectedGenre, setSelectedGenre] = useState<Genre | null>(null);`

So, now when we select genre, the _GenreList_ component should notify the _App_ component to set the selected genre. The component that holds the state, should be the one updating it.

We add a new prop called `onSelectGenre` in GenreList component, a callback function that takes genre object as a parameter will be passed to App component to update selected genre. This is to notify the parent or the consumer of this component, that genre has been selected. The parent of this component is App component. So, here we get notified and set the selected genre. Now, this causes the App component to re-render. In the next render, will pass the selected genre to the GameGrid, so it can be passed to the backend while fetching the games.

In GameGrid component, we added a new prop, which is selectedGenre. Next, this value should be passed to games hook as an argument. Then, games hook passes the selectedGenre as a query string parameter to data hook.

After that, we need to update the data hook as well. Even though, data hook currently only takes an endpoint, we need to make it more flexible by giving it` AxiosRequestConfig` object. So, we can pass query string parameters or request data to our request objects. We also added an array of dependencies. So, if any of these dependencies change, effect hook will rerun and refresh the data from the server.
